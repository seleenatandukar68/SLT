# SLT
SLT is the name of the store my father own in Kathmandu, Nepal. He runs business regarding bag sales. In this project I tried to incorporate the inventory for managing the bags. There is the facility to store the bag details, edit or delete them and view the details for convinience. Futher will be working on sales module (similar to POS), then will be incorporating profit-loss reports,etc. 
At the moment, this is a simple inventory management software.
